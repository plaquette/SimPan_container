A very very heavy container for running **SimPan**, including all necessary dependencies.

The container is optimized for ease of use with a simple command structure.

 The script `SimPan.py` is accessible globally within the container -> It from any directory with a single command.
  
**Alias**: the command `sb` is provided as a shortcut for `python SimPan.py`

All dependencies, including Python libraries and system libraries, are installed
